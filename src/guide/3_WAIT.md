# STEP 3/6: MANAGING PAGE LOADING

## Objective

Find the element that appears last in the page loading process,
finding the CSS selector that identifies it, testing it with Selenium.
This serves to recognize when the page is completely loaded.


## Instructions

1. Explain to the user that you will now identify together which element of the page loads last.
2. Ask the user to reload the page and carefully observe the loading process to identify
    which visible element on the page appears last. It can be also an information of interest.
3. Ask the user to write in the chat the exact text of this element that loads last.
4. Search for the element that contains that text using Selenium tools.
5. Once the element is found, get its CSS selector.
6. Test the CSS selector by reloading the page and verifying that the element is present after loading.
7. Ask the user to confirm that this is indeed the element that appears last.
8. Keep in mind this CSS selector as "wait condition" for page loading.
9. Ask the user to confirm "ok" before proceeding to the next step.
